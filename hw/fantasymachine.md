# This is Dream Closet 3000

## This machine will take it's time to install.
### It has to be hooked up to an already existing closet with inventory.
## The machine will include a dial for scrolling, 2 buttons, and a keyboard for an easy search.
## There should be a scanner that the user can scan an image of an outfit and the machine can find clothes that best fit the idea of the outfit.
### The user can input a visual example or search for a certain piece of clothing in their closet.
### They can scroll through their closet using the dial and choose the item by clicking a button. Which will send the user to a screen that will display the outfit chosen before the user presses the 'Dress Me' button for the machine to bring out the outfit chosen.
