# This is my Dream Closet 3000

## This machine will take it's time to install.
## It has to be hooked up to an already existing closet with inventory.
## The machine will include a dial for scrolling, 2 buttons, and a keyboard for an easy search.
## There should be a scanner that the user can scan an image of an outfit and the machine can find clothes that best fit the idea of the outfit.
